# Predicting-Death-Events-for-Heart-Failure
The analysis explores into the solution's technological implementation, beginning with data
pretreatment and exploratory data analysis. We demonstrate our findings using interesting
visuals that shed light on important relationships and distributions within the dataset. The
predictive modelling approach is then described in depth, using Random Forest, Neural
Network, and Logistic Regression models. These models have varied degrees of accuracy and
have the capacity to forecast mortality occurrences depending on patient characteristics.
In summary, our BI-driven approach presents a significant opportunity to revolutionize heart
failure patient care, reduce mortality rates, and allocate resources efficiently. By combining
medical expertise with cutting-edge analytics, the Westway Medical Clinic is poised to make
a substantial positive impact on patient outcomes and healthcare practices.
